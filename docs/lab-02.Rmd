### The 5 counties with the most cases is shown below.

### The counties with the most new cases is shown below.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

## Safe counties in California:
### The state of California has determined that counties in which there have been more than 100 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past 14 days are to placed on a watch list that monitors for worsening coronavirus trends. Below are the safe counties based on this criteria.


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
knitr::kable(last14days,
             col.names = c('County'))
```

## Analysis:

### In the second plot we scaled for population and you can that although California has a large number of new cases, the number of new cases per capita is lower compared to Florida and Louisiana which are experiencing a large number of new cases with respect to population.
